# Boyd-Granville

The release branch exists to feature working versions of our product, especially which constitute the final output of each sprint.

I think it might be useful to explore alternatives for our front-end implementation before we commit to one. We've discussed using React and Vue.js, so I'll configure working projects for each. I think we should also consider using Next.js which provides extended capabilities for React, providing convenient features like automatic component routing which will save us time. The workflow is similar to React and it supports all the familiar dependencies.
